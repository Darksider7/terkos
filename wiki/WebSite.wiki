The VEXPro features an on-board web site for various configuration and diagnostics.  Access the site with your favorite web browser by entering the VEXPro's IP address (which you can obtain via the LCD Menu's *Wireless Networking* -> *Wireless Status* -> *Info* menu option).

  * *[WebSite#Wireless_Networking Wireless Networking]*
  * *[WebSite#User_Programs User Programs]*
