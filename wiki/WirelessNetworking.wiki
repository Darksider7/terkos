The VEXPro features an 802.11g wireless adapter.  The VEXPro supports open (unencrypted) networks, WEP and WPA encrypted networks, and ad-hoc networking.

You can list and join open networks and start/stop ad-hoc networking via the VEXPro's [LCDMenu LCD Menu].  The on-board [WebSite Web Site] enables you to configure both unencrypted and encrypted wireless networks, set preferred search order, etc.  The [LCDMenu LCD Menu] and [WebSite Web Site] sections discuss wireless networking usage and configuration in more detail.

You can also configure wireless networking via the command line.  To do so, first connect to the VEXPro as described in the [SerialConsole USB Serial Console] instructions.  Once you are at the VEXPro command prompt, launch the wireless networking configuration utility like this:

   `root@qwerk:~# /opt/scripts/setupWirelessNetworking.pl`

The program will guide you through the setup.  Once complete, just reboot your VEXPro and it should connect to the network you specified.
