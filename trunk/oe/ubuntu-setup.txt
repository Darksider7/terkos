Setting up TerkOS build on Ubuntu Linux
---------------------------------------
David Huggins-Daines <dhuggins@cs.cmu.edu>

First, install all mandatory packages, as described at:

http://wiki.openembedded.net/index.php/OEandYourDistro#Debian

Now, reconfigure dash so that /bin/sh points to bash rather than dash:

  sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

You will also have to change the sysctl parameter vm.mmap_min_addr:

  sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr=0

To make this change persistent across reboot, create a file in
/etc/sysctl.d:

  echo vm.mmap_min_addr=0 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/60-openembedded.conf

Now you should be ready to build!  Be aware that the version of CVS on
Ubuntu 8.04 LTS is broken, so if you are using that version of Ubuntu,
you will need to install the one from 8.10:

  http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/cvs

Next, change to the oe/ directory and source the 'oe.vars' file in your shell:

  cd oe
  . oe.vars

Finally, edit oe/build/conf/local.conf to set the OEBASE variable:

  perl -i.orig -pe 's/OEBASE = .*/OEBASE = "$ENV{OEBASE}"/' build/conf/local.conf

Now you are ready to build!  The command to build the VexPro kernel and image is:

  bitbake vexpro-image

To build the SDK, run:

  bitbake meta-toolchain

And to build the Windows SDK:

  bitbake canadian-sdk
